    <p>If you just put all the content in an HTML file with no markup, it just ends up as one big blob on the website. The browser assumes it's all one long string of text.</p>

<p>We can try to create separate paragraphs by leaving a bunch of space in our HTML file, but that space doesn't count. The browser ignores it. All these words simply add up to a bunch of words in a row.</p>

<p>The browser doesn't know what this is, because we haven't used any HTML yet to tell it what this is.</p>
